# number_guessing_game
I am thinking of a number between 1-100.  Can you guess what number I am thinking in 5 guesses or less?
This is my first Python program after watching some tutorials.  It works, but I am sure it isn't written very well and could use some
critiquing.  This is also my first time using github to upload from pycharm.
